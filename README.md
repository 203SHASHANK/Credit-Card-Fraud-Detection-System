# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-System
This  project focuses on the implementation and comparison of three fraud detection methods for credit cards: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). The primary evaluation metrics include Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, and Error Rate, crucial for assessing the system's performance.
