# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-System
This  project focuses on the implementation and comparison of three fraud detection methods for credit cards: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). The primary evaluation metrics include Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, and Error Rate, crucial for assessing the system's performance.

Key Features:

>>>ANN, RNN, and GRU Models: Implementations of three powerful neural network architectures tailored for credit card fraud detection.

>>>Performance Metrics: The project extensively evaluates each model's effectiveness using Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, and Error Rate, providing a comprehensive understanding of their capabilities.

>>>Results Analysis: After rigorous testing, the comparative study reveals that the GRU classifier outperforms both ANN and RNN. GRU achieves an impressive accuracy of 99.9%, surpassing ANN (99.87%) and RNN (96.93%).

Why GRU?

GRU demonstrates superior fraud detection capabilities, making it an ideal choice for credit card security applications.

The detailed analysis in this project provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each method, aiding practitioners in informed decision-making.
